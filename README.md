# Application-of-ML-in-detecting-Systemic-Risk-Emission
The project aims to examine the systemic risk that is produced by publicly listed financial institutions in the United Kingdom, which is one of the major financial centres worldwide. This paper uses the Tobias and Brunnermeier (2016) estimator to measure the systemic risk emission (ΔCoVaR) attributed by each institution and categorise them into different risk levels. 
To accomplish this goal, the study utilises several machine learning methods such as random forest, neural networks, and gradient boosting machine. The primary objective is to examine imbalanced datasets to detect certain fundamental features in a bank's balance sheet and stock performance that have a substantial impact on the emission of systemic risk.
Experimental results suggest that random forest and gradient boosting machine models demonstrate better efficacy in forecasting systemic risk. This study highlights the crucial significance of macro-economic variables and institution’s balance sheet ratio.
The findings have substantial practical consequences for both banks and regulators. The revealed features can inform policy decisions targeted at reducing systemic risk and fostering financial stability. This paper enhances current knowledge by presenting categorisation theories in the context of systemic risk, therefore providing a detailed comprehension of the elements that contribute to the probability of risk emission.
